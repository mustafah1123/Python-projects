I used a few outside references to help me complete the project.  I listed them below.

Also in order to display the raw data as a fancy grid with all the columns, I did the following:
-Used the set_option method set max columns to None so it can show all the columns
-Imported the tabulate module.  This module does not come standard so I installed using pip.
Please install if it doesn't exist on your computer prior to running the code or it will throw an error.

Prior to running the code, please expand the terminal window as much as possible so that the entire 
grid can show correctly.
