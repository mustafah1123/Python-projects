# Python projects
This is a repository of all the Python projects I have created for either a course 
or to simply test my potential in programming

-The Bikeshare folder contains the bikeshare.py program along with the Excel files that are used
by the program to import data

-The Creating Classes and Subclasses from Numbers Sets is a program to help understand the connection
between Classes and Number Sets in Math and how subclasses are the subsets of a higher set
For example, the Integers class is created as a subclass of the Rationals as the set of integers is
a subset of rationals
